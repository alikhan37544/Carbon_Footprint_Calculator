# Carbon_Footprint_Calculator
Our Project for Carbon Emission Generation

Carbon Emission Calculator:
The idea is that it is personalised a lot. 
We calculate the carbon footprint of a certain given place depending on the inputs that the user gives us. We will try to import as much data as possible, like for example electricity consumption, Food consumption, travel etc
We will also give out suggestions to offset your carbon footprint like for example planting trees, taking public transport etc

We could also profile all of this into a database and have different users have different things.
Also we could personalize the things that we have there and give you as accurate a reading as possible.
